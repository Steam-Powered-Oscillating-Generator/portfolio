                <p>Tesla was a GENIUS! He spoke eighth languages - Serbian, English, Czech, German, France, Hungarian, Italian
                and Latin. He could memorize Entire books and recite them at will. He could visualize devices entirely in
                his head and then build them without ever writing anything down.
